# Team Work Contract

**How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?**

Each of the 2 members will be responsible for roughly half of the workload. This will be divided by Milestone, with Jonah taking the R version and Alyssa taking the Python version.



**What are the expected work hours for the project?**

Project goals are task-based, not hours-based. As a result, the work hours required are only those required to finish your portion of the project.




**How often will group meetings occur?**

Once weekly (during lab), and as needed.






**What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?**

Work to the best of your ability (and time constraints).






**Other thoughts**

All written communication will occur through Discord.
